# theaterofthemind
Theater of the Mind is a hybrid experience of theater, performance art and art exhibition, based on the work of neuroscience labs around the world. Intimate audience groups of 16 go on a journey through a series of rooms with a guide, whose unfolding memories of a life lived backwards steers the investigation. Together, we are the subject of the work. The experience is visceral, emotional, and engaging, and from this journey comes a newfound sense of interdependence. We believe that Theater of the Mind is relevant and compelling because it offers audiences the opportunity to re-examine their assumptions about reality through first-hand encounters that demonstrate the individual, contextual, biased and malleable nature of perception. If we can change how we understand we see the world, what else can we change?
