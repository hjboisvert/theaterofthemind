### Multisensory Chair Test Console

This directory contains a Max/MSP patch and bundled Windows runtime for testing the functions of the Britta multisensory controller outside of Medialon. 

`TotM Britta Test Console.maxpat` is the original, editable patch, which requires Max/MSP to be installed.

[TotM Britta Test Console.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LnZckVGHMxvZCmQQ0vepBXj6vLpTqgNC/view?usp=sharing) contains an exe file and includes Max/MSP runtimes, so it can be run standalone on any Windows computer. The contents of this zip directory are read-only.

Be sure to allow the software through the Windows firewall, which may prompt for access at start.
